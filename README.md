# Mythology Storyteller Gradio App
This repository hosts a Gradio web application that uses the fine-tuned GPT-Neo Mythology Storyteller model (available at [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/Samurai719214/gptneo-mythology-storyteller)) to generate complete mythological narratives. Given an incomplete story excerpt, the model generates a complete chapter narrative.

## Features
- **Interactive Interface:** Built with Gradio, making it easy to use directly in your browser.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Generation parameters such as `max_new_tokens`, `temperature`, and `top_p` can be adjusted within the code if needed.
